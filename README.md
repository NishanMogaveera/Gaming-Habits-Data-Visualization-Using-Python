# Gaming-Habits-Data-Visualization-Using-Python

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data from real-world datasets using Python. The main goal is to turn raw data into meaningful insights through clear and visually appealing charts. Using libraries like Matplotlib, Pandas, and Seaborn, this project demonstrates how data can be cleaned, processed, and represented effectively through graphs such as bar charts, line plots, pie charts, and histograms.
